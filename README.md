# File Converter

Simple scripts to convert files between different formats. Includes a local web UI.

## Quick Start

### Web UI

Upload a file, pick a target format, download the result. Two terminals, both run from
the project root:

```bash
# Terminal 1: frontend
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: backend
uv run uvicorn server:app --app-dir backend --reload --port 8019 --loop asyncio
```

Open **http://localhost:3004**. Both have to be running.

Converting several files at once runs them one after another. A **Cancel** button
appears next to Download All while any conversion is running, and stops the batch
before it picks up the next file, files already converted stay downloadable. For the
local-model conversion below, cancelling also stops the file currently converting
after its current page and keeps whatever pages already finished as the download;
for every other conversion, the file already in progress just finishes normally.

The second **Convert to** column ("Scripts use LLMs for conversion.") is for the PDF to
Markdown conversion that runs on a local model. Pick a PDF, click **MD**, then pick one
of your Open Source models, listed weakest to strongest. Convert stays disabled until
you pick one. A model has to be downloaded first (`ollama pull <model>`), and models
that aren't are greyed out with the pull command on hover. Ollama itself has to be
running (open the Ollama app or run `ollama serve`). The OpenAI and Claude versions of
this conversion are CLI only for now, see `llm_pdf_md.py` below.

`--app-dir backend` and `--loop asyncio` are both required, the backend won't start
without them.

### Individual Scripts
Each script can be run independently for specific conversions (see details below).

## Scripts

**Note on script structure:** every conversion script keeps its logic in a named
function behind an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, so importing a script never
runs a conversion as a side effect. Keep that pattern when adding new converters,
otherwise the web server can't import them safely.

### xlsx_csv.py
Converts Excel (.xlsx) to CSV (.csv).

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/xlsx_csv.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pandas>=2.2.3

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL XLSX files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts Excel files to CSV format
3. Saves CSV files to the `output/` folder

### csv_xlsx.py
Converts CSV (.csv) to Excel (.xlsx).

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/csv_xlsx.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pandas>=2.2.3
- openpyxl>=3.1.5

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL CSV files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts CSV files to Excel format
3. Saves XLSX files to the `output/` folder

### csv_md.py
Converts CSV (.csv) files to Markdown (.md) tables.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/csv_md.py
```

**Python packages:**
- None beyond the standard library

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL CSV files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts each CSV into a Markdown table with a header row and separator row
3. Saves markdown files to the `output/` folder

### pdf_md.py
Converts PDF files to Markdown. Searchable pages become real Markdown (headings, lists, tables, code) via pymupdf4llm; scanned/image pages fall back to Tesseract OCR, handled page by page so mixed PDFs work. Math notation (LaTeX `\( \)` / `$$`, super/subscripts, operators) is normalized.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/pdf_md.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pymupdf4llm>=0.0.17
- pymupdf>=1.26.4
- pytesseract>=0.3.13
- pillow>=11.3.0

**System requirements (for OCR on scanned PDFs):**
- Tesseract OCR (macOS: `brew install tesseract`)

### llm_pdf_md.py
Converts PDF files to Markdown using an LLM (OpenAI's Vision API, Anthropic's Claude, or a
local Ollama vision model) for high-quality conversion.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/llm_pdf_md.py            # no args: menu of ChatGPT/Anthropic/Open Source models to pick from
python backend/llm_pdf_md.py anthropic  # Claude
python backend/llm_pdf_md.py local              # local Ollama, prompts you to pick a model
python backend/llm_pdf_md.py local qwen3.5:9b   # local Ollama, model given directly
```

Conversion isn't instant, especially on the local Ollama path: each page is a separate
model call, and a local vision model can take well over a minute per page depending on
your hardware. Expect it to take a while, particularly with Open Source models.

**Python packages:**
- vision-parse>=0.1.13 (OpenAI path)
- anthropic>=1.0 (Claude path)
- requests>=2.32.3 (local path, already a dependency)
- python-dotenv>=1.1.1
- openai>=2.7.1 (installed as dependency)

**Configuration:**
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add the key for whichever cloud provider you want to use, or both:
   - OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
   - Anthropic: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

The OpenAI path renders each page to an image and sends it to `gpt-4o-mini` (default) or
`gpt-4o`. The Claude path sends the PDF itself to `claude-sonnet-5` (default) or
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, which read PDFs natively (limit 32 MB per file). Pick the
model from the no-arg menu, or pass it as the second argument, e.g.
`python backend/llm_pdf_md.py anthropic claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Both cost money and
bill the key they use.

**Local (Ollama) path:**
- Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running locally (`ollama serve`, or
  just open the Ollama app)
- **The model must be pulled before running the script** — Ollama does not auto-download
  on first use here. Pull one with `ollama pull qwen3.5:9b` (or any other vision-capable
  model, e.g. `ollama pull gemma4:12b`). Check what you already have with `ollama list`.
- `qwen3.5` and `gemma4` are reasoning models — the script sends `think: false` so they
  skip the reasoning step, since straight transcription doesn't need it. A plain
  vision model avoids that entirely: `ollama pull llama3.2-vision` or
  `ollama pull minicpm-v`.
- Free, no API key, nothing sent over the network. Slower than the cloud paths, and
  quality depends entirely on the model you pick.
- Renders each page to an image, same idea as the OpenAI path, and sends it to the model
  you choose. The CLI lists whatever models are installed in Ollama (`ollama list`);
  `OLLAMA_MODEL` in the script (`qwen3.5:9b`) is only the fallback when `local` is run
  and Ollama can't be reached or has no models installed. The model unloads from memory
  15 seconds after the last page (`OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`), instead of Ollama's normal
  5-minute idle default.

**Page limit (Claude path):** roughly 100 pages per PDF, fewer for dense text or
table-heavy PDFs. The whole PDF is converted in one request with output capped at 64K
tokens, so a longer PDF gets cut off and fails, and you're still billed for what it
wrote.

**Rate limit (OpenAI path):** no length cap, since pages are converted one at a time,
but every page goes out as an image, and a long PDF can hit OpenAI's tokens-per-minute
rate limit. The script doesn't wait out a rate limit, so the PDF fails with no output,
and you're still billed for the pages it got through. A 41-page PDF hit this on an
account limited to 200K tokens per minute. For long PDFs, use the Claude path.

**Setup:**
All dependencies are installed automatically when you run `uv sync`

**Important Note:**
Combining several images into one large image before converting to PDF makes this script
very slow and can make it fail. See [CONVERSIONS.md](CONVERSIONS.md) for why, and what to
do instead.

### ss_txt.py
Converts screenshots and images to text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Has two modes: plain text (default) and structured content (tables/layout).

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/ss_txt.py               # simple mode: plain-text screenshots
python backend/ss_txt.py --structured  # structured mode: tables / complex layout
```

**Python packages:**
- pytesseract>=0.3.13
- pillow>=11.3.0
- opencv-python>=4.12.0.88
- numpy>=2.2.5

**System requirements:**
- Tesseract OCR (macOS: `brew install tesseract`)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install Tesseract OCR on macOS
brew install tesseract

# Python packages are installed via pyproject.toml
uv sync
```

**Supported formats:**
- PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL images in the `input/` folder
2. Preprocesses images for better OCR accuracy
3. Extracts text using OCR with proper sentence structure
4. Fixes random line breaks and preserves sentence flow

**Simple mode (default):**
- Image preprocessing for better accuracy
- Sentence structure preservation and line-break fixing
- Saves combined text to `output/all_extracted_text_combined.txt`

**Structured mode (`--structured` / `--tables`):**
- OpenCV table detection (bordered and borderless) and per-cell OCR
- Heavy OCR-error correction, formats tables with `|` separators
- Better handling of complex layouts
- Saves to `output/all_extracted_structured_text.txt`

### ipynb_pdf.py
Converts Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) to PDF files.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Option A: run with no args – auto-detect a single notebook in input/
python backend/ipynb_pdf.py

# Option B: specify a file (filename only; script prepends input/)
python backend/ipynb_pdf.py notebook_name.ipynb
python backend/ipynb_pdf.py notebook_name.ipynb custom_output.pdf
```

**Python packages:**
- jupyter>=1.1.1
- nbconvert>=7.16.6
- nbclient>=0.10.2
- nbformat>=5.10.4
- jinja2>=3.1.6
- traitlets>=5.14.3

**System requirements:**
- LaTeX distribution for PDF export (macOS: `brew install --cask mactex`)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Python packages installed via pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Install LaTeX on macOS
brew install --cask mactex
```

**How it works:**
1. Put your `.ipynb` file in the `input/` folder
2. If you run without arguments and there is exactly one notebook in `input/`,
   the script prints only the file name (e.g., `HW2.ipynb`) and converts it.
3. If multiple notebooks are present, it lists them and asks you to specify one.
4. If none are present, it shows usage instructions.
5. PDF is saved to the `output/` folder. Custom output filenames are supported.

**Alternative (no LaTeX):**
If you prefer not to install LaTeX, you can export using the browser-based PDF:
```bash
pip install pyppeteer
jupyter nbconvert --to webpdf --output output/NAME.pdf input/NAME.ipynb
```

### md_pdf.py
Converts Markdown (.md) files to PDF using Pandoc with enhanced math symbol and formatting support.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Convert all .md files in input/ folder
python backend/md_pdf.py

# Convert specific file
python backend/md_pdf.py file.md [output.pdf]
```

**Python packages:**
- nbconvert>=7.16.6 (only for pandocfilters; not strictly required to run pandoc)
- pandocfilters>=1.5.1 (installed, but conversion is done by the pandoc CLI)

**System requirements:**
- Pandoc (macOS: `brew install pandoc`)
- LaTeX engine (XeLaTeX recommended) for PDF generation (macOS: `brew install --cask mactex`)
- mermaid-filter for Mermaid diagram support (requires Node.js/pnpm):
  ```bash
  pnpm add -g mermaid-filter
  ```

**Features:**
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Renders directed/undirected graphs, flowcharts, and more using Mermaid syntax:
  ````
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      a -->|3| b
      b -->|5| c
  ```
  ````
  Supported layout directions: `LR` (left-right), `TD` (top-down), `RL`, `BT`
- **ASCII art diagrams**: Automatically detects and preserves ASCII graph diagrams (arrows like `-->`, `<--`, pipe characters) in a monospace block so spacing is not lost
- **Unicode math symbols**: Properly renders Unicode symbols in math mode:
  - Greek letters: ε (epsilon), α (alpha), β (beta), γ (gamma), δ (delta), θ (theta), λ (lambda), μ (mu), σ (sigma), ρ (rho), τ (tau), π (pi)
  - Comparison operators: ≤ (less than or equal), ≥ (greater than or equal)
  - Other symbols: ± (plus-minus), ≈ (approximately equal)
  - Set theory: ∪ (union), ∩ (intersection), ∈ (element of), ∃ (exists), ∀ (for all), ⋈ (bowtie)
- **Unicode subscripts**: Converts Unicode subscripts (₀, ₁, ₂, etc.) to LaTeX subscripts:
  - `θ₀` → `$\theta_0$`, `x₁` → `$x_1$`, `θₙ` → `$\theta_n$`
- **LaTeX math commands**: Converts complex symbols to LaTeX commands:
  - ∑ (sum), ∫ (integral), ∞ (infinity), ≠ (not equal)
- **Math expression combination**: Automatically combines adjacent math expressions in table cells:
  - `$d_i$ = $y_i$ - $x_i$` → `$d_i = y_i - x_i$`
- **Table page break prevention**: Tables automatically move to the next page if they don't fit, preventing tables from splitting across pages
- **Horizontal rules**: Converts `---` to proper spacing/breaks
- **Inline math mode**: Keeps math symbols on the same line as text
- **Font support**: Uses fontspec and amssymb for proper Unicode and LaTeX symbol rendering
- **Display math**: Supports both `$$...$$` and `\[...\]` for display math blocks

### html_pdf.py
Converts HTML files to PDF. Prefers `wkhtmltopdf`; falls back to `pandoc` if unavailable.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/html_pdf.py file.html [output.pdf]
```

**Python packages:**
- None beyond the standard library

**System requirements:**
- wkhtmltopdf (recommended for best HTML rendering) — macOS: `brew install wkhtmltopdf`
- or Pandoc with LaTeX engine (fallback) — macOS: `brew install pandoc` and `brew install --cask mactex`

### heic_jpg.py
Converts HEIC images (typically from iPhone/iPad) to JPG files.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/heic_jpg.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pillow>=11.3.0
- pillow-heif>=0.22.0

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL HEIC files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts images to JPG format at 95% quality
3. Saves JPG files to the `output/` folder

### heic_pdf.py
Converts HEIC images (typically from iPhone/iPad) to PDF files, one page per image.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/heic_pdf.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pillow>=11.3.0
- pillow-heif>=0.22.0

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL HEIC files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts each image to RGB and saves it as a single-page PDF
3. Saves PDF files to the `output/` folder
4. Shows summary of successful/failed conversions

### jpg_pdf.py
Converts JPG/JPEG images to PDF files.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/jpg_pdf.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pillow>=11.3.0

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL JPG/JPEG files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts images to PDF format
3. Saves PDF files to the `output/` folder
4. Shows summary of successful/failed conversions

### png_pdf.py
Converts PNG images to PDF files.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/png_pdf.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pillow>=11.3.0

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL PNG files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts images to PDF format (handles transparency by converting to RGB)
3. Saves PDF files to the `output/` folder
4. Shows summary of successful/failed conversions

### png_svg.py
Converts PNG images to SVG by tracing them into vector paths. This is real
vectorization, not the source PNG wrapped in an `<svg>` tag, so the result scales to
any size without pixelating and can be edited as vector art.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/png_svg.py
```

**Python packages:**
- vtracer>=0.6.15

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL PNG files in the `input/` folder
2. Traces each bitmap into filled SVG paths, in color, fitting spline curves
3. Saves SVG files to the `output/` folder

Best on flat-color art: logos, icons, line drawings, screenshots of UI. Photographs
have no flat regions to trace, so they come back as tens of thousands of tiny paths,
slow to produce and larger than the PNG they came from. The conversion still reports
success, it just isn't worth running on a photo.

The script calls vtracer with its defaults. If the output looks wrong, the knobs worth
reaching for are `colormode` (`color` or `binary`), `mode` (`spline` or `polygon`) and
`filter_speckle`, passed to the `convert_image_to_svg_py` call in the script.

### jpg_ocr.py
Converts JPG/JPEG images to plain text (.txt) using OCR. Same OCR as `jpg_md.py`, but
the output is plain text with no Markdown formatting.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/jpg_ocr.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pytesseract>=0.3.13
- pillow>=11.3.0

**System requirements:**
- Tesseract OCR (macOS: `brew install tesseract`)

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL JPG/JPEG files in the `input/` folder
2. Converts each image to RGB and runs Tesseract OCR through a temporary PNG
3. Saves text files to the `output/` folder

### jpg_png.py
Converts JPG/JPEG images to PNG.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/jpg_png.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pillow>=11.3.0

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL JPG/JPEG files in the `input/` folder
2. Saves PNG files to the `output/` folder

JPEG carries no transparency, so nothing is lost crossing to PNG. The file will
usually get larger, since PNG is lossless and JPEG is not.

### jpg_svg.py
Converts JPG/JPEG images to SVG by tracing them into vector paths. Same tracing as
`png_svg.py`, but reading a lossy source.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/jpg_svg.py
```

**Python packages:**
- vtracer>=0.6.15

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL JPG/JPEG files in the `input/` folder
2. Traces each bitmap into filled SVG paths, in color, fitting spline curves
3. Saves SVG files to the `output/` folder

Two things make JPG a worse tracing source than PNG. JPEG is lossy, so every edge
carries ringing artifacts, and tracing reads that noise as real color regions. The same
flat-color test image traced from PNG gives 4 paths in 3 colors and a 7.9 KB SVG; saved
as JPEG at quality 85 first, it gives 71 paths in 65 colors and a 48.3 KB SVG. Trace
the PNG if you have one. Pass a higher `filter_speckle` to the
`convert_image_to_svg_py` call if the output is littered with tiny stray shapes. JPEG
is also the format
photographs arrive in, and a photo has no flat regions to trace, so it comes back as
tens of thousands of paths, slower to produce and larger than the source. For a photo,
use `jpg_pdf.py` or `jpg_png.py` and keep it a raster.

### heic_png.py
Converts HEIC images (typically from iPhone/iPad) to PNG.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/heic_png.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pillow>=11.3.0
- pillow-heif>=0.22.0

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL HEIC files in the `input/` folder
2. Saves PNG files to the `output/` folder

Unlike `heic_jpg.py`, this keeps an alpha channel when the source has one, since PNG
supports transparency.

### pdf_png.py
Renders PDF pages to PNG images.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/pdf_png.py
```

**Python packages:**
- pymupdf>=1.26.4

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL PDF files in the `input/` folder
2. Renders every page and saves PNG files to the `output/` folder
3. A single-page PDF produces `name.png`; a multi-page one produces `name_page1.png`,
   `name_page2.png`, and so on

**Resolution:** PDF pages are vector, so the output resolution is a choice rather than
a property of the file. `RENDER_DPI` at the top of the script sets it, defaulting to
200, which keeps body text sharp on screen without making every page a multi-megabyte
PNG. In the web UI a multi-page PDF comes back as a zip.

### pptx_pdf.py
Converts PowerPoint (.pptx) files to PDF using LibreOffice.

**Usage:**
```bash
python backend/pptx_pdf.py

  ```

**How it works:**
1. Automatically processes ALL PPTX files in the `input/` folder
2. Uses LibreOffice headless mode to convert to PDF
3. Saves PDF files to the `output/` folder
4. Shows summary of successful/failed conversions

### pptx_md.py

  Rscript -e 'install.packages("rmarkdown")'
  ```
- or Pandoc with LaTeX engine (fallback) — macOS: `brew install pandoc` and `brew install --cask mactex`

**How it works:**
1. Tries R's rmarkdown first (executes R code chunks)
2. Falls back to pandoc if R unavailable (treats as plain markdown)
3. Saves PDF files to the `output/` folder

### combine_files.py
Combines multiple files into one output file. Automatically detects file types and combines accordingly.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Combine all files in input/ folder (auto-detects format)
python backend/combine_files.py

# Combine specific files
python backend/combine_files.py file1.jpg file2.jpg

# Combine with custom output name
python backend/combine_files.py file1.pdf file2.pdf combined.pdf
```

**Python packages:**
- pillow>=11.3.0
- pypdf>=6.0.0

**How it works:**
1. Reads files from the `input/` folder (or specified files)
2. Checks that every file has the same extension, and refuses the job if not
3. Combines according to type:
   - **Images** (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP) → stacks vertically into one image (`combined.jpg`)
   - **PDFs** → merges all pages into one PDF (`combined.pdf`)
   - **Text files** → concatenates with separators showing filenames (`combined.txt`)
4. Saves combined file to the `output/` folder as `combined.<ext>`
5. Skips system files like `.DS_Store`

**Same extension only.** Every input has to be the same format. Mixing them used to
succeed while producing junk: a `.jpg` with a `.png` fell into the image branch, and a
`.pdf` with a `.txt` fell into the text branch and wrote raw PDF bytes into a text
file. Neither reported a failure. The mix is now rejected up front with a message
naming what it found. `.jpeg`/`.jpg`, `.tif`/`.tiff` and `.htm`/`.html` count as the
same format, so those pairs are still allowed.

**Ordering.** Files are combined in the order you pass them, and the web UI passes
them in the order you added them. Nothing is re-sorted. The one exception is running
the script with no arguments, where there is no "order you added them" to honour, so
it falls back to a natural sort of the `input/` folder (Q1, Q2, Q10).

**Features:**
- Output format matches the input format (JPG→JPG, PDF→PDF, etc.)
- Images are stacked vertically in a single image file
- Text files are concatenated with clear file separators
- PDFs are merged preserving all pages in order

**Note:** stacking many images produces one very tall image, which is the exact input
that makes the combined-image chain in [CONVERSIONS.md](CONVERSIONS.md) fail. If the
combined file is headed for Markdown, combine PDFs instead of images.

```

**Note:** `input/` and `output/` live inside `backend/`, since that's where the
converting happens. Every script resolves those folders relative to its own file, so
they work the same no matter which directory you run from.

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.11 or higher

## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync
   
   # Or using pip
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Create the required folders** (if they don't exist):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p backend/input backend/output
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies** (as needed):
   - **Tesseract OCR** (required for OCR features): `brew install tesseract`
     - Note: This must be installed via brew, not through Python packages
   - Pandoc: `brew install pandoc` (for markdown/HTML conversions)
   - LaTeX: `brew install --cask mactex` (for PDF generation)
   - LibreOffice: `brew install --cask libreoffice` (for PowerPoint conversion)
   - mermaid-filter (for Mermaid diagrams in `md_pdf.py`): `pnpm add -g mermaid-filter`
   - Ollama (for the local, free path in `llm_pdf_md.py`): `brew install ollama`, then
     start it (`ollama serve`, or open the Ollama app) and **pull a vision-capable model
     before running the script**, e.g. `ollama pull qwen3.5:9b`. Nothing downloads
     automatically on first use, so this step has to happen first.

4. **Optional: Set up API keys** (for `llm_pdf_md.py`):
   ```bash
   # Create .env file. OPENAI_API_KEY powers the OpenAI PDF converter,
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY powers the Claude PDF converter. Add whichever you use.
   # Not needed for the local Ollama path, that one uses no API key at all.
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
   ```

## Keeping Up to Date

To keep your environment synchronized with the latest dependencies:

```bash
# From the project root directory
uv sync

# Or update dependencies to latest compatible versions
uv sync --upgrade
```

## How to Use

### Using Individual Scripts
1. Put your files in the `input` folder
2. Run the appropriate conversion script (e.g., `python backend/md_pdf.py`)
3. Find converted files in the `output` folder

### File Overwriting
**Important:** Converting the same file multiple times will automatically overwrite the existing output file. For example:
- First conversion: `mock2.md` → `output/mock2.pdf` (creates new file)
- Second conversion: `mock2.md` → `output/mock2.pdf` (overwrites the existing PDF)

This means you can update your source file and convert it again to get an updated PDF without needing to delete the old one first. Every script prints `Overwrote existing file: <name>` to the terminal when this happens, so it's never silent.

## Flows That Don't Work

Some conversion chains run without erroring but produce bad output. They're listed in
[CONVERSIONS.md](CONVERSIONS.md), along with why each one fails and what to use instead.
